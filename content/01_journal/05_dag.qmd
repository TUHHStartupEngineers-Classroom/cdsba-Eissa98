```{R}
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

collider <- dagify(
  P ~ S_AB ,
  P ~ S_CD,
  coords = list(x = c(S_CD = 3, P = 2, S_AB = 1),
                y = c(S_CD = 1, P = 0, S_AB = 1))
)

# Plot DAG
ggdag(collider) 
```

```{R}
customer_sat <- readRDS("D:/TU Hamburg/Semester_5/Causal Data Science for Business Analytics/Causal_Data_Science_Data/Causal_Data_Science_Data/customer_sat.rds")
View(customer_sat)

```

2.1
```{R}
lm_customers <- lm(satisfaction ~ follow_ups, data = customer_sat)
summary(lm_customers)
```


2.2:
```{R}
lm_customers_account_for_subscription <- lm(satisfaction ~ follow_ups + subscription, data = customer_sat)
summary(lm_customers_account_for_subscription)
```
3- It seems that the follow_ups with account to subscription has higher correlation with satisfaction, compared with follow_ups only according the adjusted R-squared value. Furthermore, the P-value of the regression between the satisfaction and the follow_ups with account to subscription is lower. Additionally, the Estimate value changed from -3.3093 to 2.1944, which change totally the relation from decreasing to increasing.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)

customers_ncond <- ggplot(customer_sat, aes(x = satisfaction , y = follow_ups)) +
geom_point() +
stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)

# Conditioning on student  
customers_cond <- ggplot(customer_sat, aes(x = satisfaction, y = follow_ups,
                            color = subscription, 
                            alpha = subscription)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c("subscription" = 1, "no_subscription" = 0.2)) +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

# Plot both
customers_ncond
customers_cond
