```{R}
hospdd_data<- readRDS("D:/TU Hamburg/Semester_5/Causal Data Science for Business Analytics/Causal_Data_Science_Data/Causal_Data_Science_Data/hospdd.rds")

View(hospdd_data)
```

```{R}
library(dplyr)

before_treatment <- hospdd_data %>%
  filter(procedure == 0) %>% 
  pull(satis)
after_treatment <- hospdd_data %>%
  filter(procedure == 1) %>% 
  pull(satis)


estimate_mean_satisfaction = after_treatment - before_treatment
estimate_mean_satisfaction
```

```{R}
summary(lm(satis ~ month+hospital, data = hospdd_data))
summary(lm(satis ~ as.factor(month)+as.factor(hospital), data = hospdd_data))

```



2- it could be noticed that using month + hospital the mean estimate for all hospitals and additions to months is computed, however, for the as.factor(month) + as.factor(hospital) the relation between each month and each hospital with satis and how they actually affect satis is computed separately.
