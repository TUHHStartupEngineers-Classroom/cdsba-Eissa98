# Source Code

Use ``` to delimit blocks of source code:

```
code
```

Add a language to syntax highlight code blocks:

Assignment I:

```{r}
pscope <- 0.3
pscope_time <- 0.2
Pnscope_time <- 0.6

```

```{r}
p_time_and_scope <-  pscope * pscope_time

p_time_and_nscope <- (1-pscope) * (1-Pnscope_time)

p_ntime_and_scope <- pscope * (1- pscope_time)

p_ntime_and_nscope <- (1 -pscope) * (1-Pnscope_time)
```

Assignment II:

Using the Venn diagram above, answer the following questions:

 1-What is the percentage of customers using all three devices?:
      
      0.5%
      
 2-What is the percentage of customers using at least two devices?  

```{r}
P_customers_two_devices = (7.3/100 + 3.3/100 + 8.8/100)*100
```

3-What is the percentage of customers using only one device?

```{r}
P_customers_one_device = (27.8/100 + 10/100 + 42.3/100) * 100
```
